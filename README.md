    Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?


1) We were given the python framework to a program which utilizes an intelligent agent to navigate a maze in the most efficient way possible. We were also given pseudocode on how to complete the project by coding out a loop that will tell the intelligent agent what to do during each epoch. The code we wrote was that above-referenced loop that dictates the actions of our intelligent agent during each epoch. 

2)Computer Scientists do a LOT. I think on a very basic level, they are problem solvers. Depending on the problem, computer scientists are able to create a solution to said problem in the most efficient way possible. In reference to this course, Computer Scientists are not only setting up neural networks and creating AI, but also examining the methods of doing so to ensure the best possible outcome. This includes on a technical level, but also on an ethical level.

3)I think understanding the problem is the first aspect to approaching a problem as a computer scientist. There's a lot of ways to solve a problem in CS, but that doesn't mean they're all the best way. Study the problems, the data, and the potential solutions to ensure that you're actually solving the problem in a responsible way.

4)I think that my ethical obligations to the end user are that I shouldn't be gathering or using data in a way that's not overtly stated. I think that can create an atmosphere of distrust around your end users. I need to ensure that the solution to the original problem was done in a way that ethically observed the various outcomes and ethical dilemmas that arose. I think that my obligations to the organization is that I will take feedback and opinions from diverse groups of people within the organization. This ensures you don't stay inside your little programming bubble while creating a solution.
